# Odin Recipes
1. This is a practice project from [Odin Project -> Foundations Path -> HTML Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes).
2. The main purpose of this project is to practice basic html including:
    1. html boilerplate (declare `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>` with `<title>` and `<meta charset="utf-8>`, `<body>`)
    2. basic html elements:
        1. heading elements like `<h1></h1>` and paragraph elements `<p></p>`
        2. anchor elements with its `href` attribute, `<a href="url"></a>`
        3. list elements, both ordered list `<ol></ol>` and unordered list `<ul></ul>`
        4. image elements with its `src` attribute, `<img src="url">` (here no need to use forward slash)
